# Gitlab Answer

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that notifies users of the correct way to contribute to our repositories.
Redirects Github PR contributors to the matching Gitlab repository.

Application needs to be manually deployed to heroku using the CLI.
In the future, application should be automatically deployed to heroku.
